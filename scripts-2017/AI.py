    -people become dumber
    -misuse of artificial intelligence that follows a set of rules different than our own
    -ai uses "nueral net" to gather information - so are companies spying on us?
   -gets rid of existing jobs that humans would normally do and replaced by robots and AI
    -population gets lazier... WallE
